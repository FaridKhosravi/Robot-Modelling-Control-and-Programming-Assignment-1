Assignment 1: DH Parameters, Forward and Inverse Kinematics

Objective:
The objective of this assignment is to use the tools offered by Robotics. Toolbox for Matlab to design and analyze an automatic manipulator.

Skills acquired:
1) Computing Modified DH Parameters
2) Working with Peter Corke matlab toolbox
3) Computing Forward kinematics
4) Computing Inverse kinematics

Approach:
1) Assign link frames
2) Determine the modified DH parameters for the PUMA robot of Figure 1. NOTE: parameters like link offset
(d) or link length (a) should be assumed intuitively in this first iteration step. Joint twitst(Î±) can be
determined from the figure
3) Model the manipulator with SerialLink command and attach the tool to the manipulator
4) Use teach command to jog the robot manually and visualize roughly if the working positions/orientations
are within the robot workspace
5) Compute the inverse kinematics of the cases A and B shown in Figure 3, if the inverse kinematics method
can not find a solution, go to step 2 and modify link offsets (d) and lengths (a)
